\section{Snapshot of \ptakopet{} frontend repository}
Besides the source code for the web application, the frontend repository contains also tools for the experiment and documentation source. The snapshot was created at \texttt{15dab17f}. It was mirrored from \href{https://github.com/zouharvi/ptakopet}{github.com/zouharvi/ptakopet}. The main repository directory structure is discussed in the technical documentation in \cref{chp:development_doc}.

\section{Snapshot of SlowAlign repository}
We used SlowAlign \href{https://vilda.net/s/slowalign/}{vilda.net/s/slowalign} to produce alignment figures. It is a snapshot of \href{https://github.com/zouharvi/SlowAlign}{github.com/zouharvi/SlowAlign} at \texttt{0a158baf}.

The attachment also contains two trained DeepQuest models, Czech$\rightarrow$German and English$\rightarrow$German and one OpenKiwi model, Czech$\rightarrow$German. They are, however, downloaded automatically when running the backend install script.
