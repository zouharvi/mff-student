This annotation is relevant to the Ptakopět/Bergamot project ([https://ptakopet.vilda.net](ptakopet.vilda.net)).

Users were asked to work with an MT system with backward translation and quality estimation. While they don't speak German, they were tasked with the translation of Czech sentences to German using this tool.
Annotating the quality of such translations is key in further research.

Participants: Martin Stunda, Vilém Zouhar

The file is comma separated: `SCORE,ID,SRC,MT`:
- `SCORE` is a value from `0` to `1.0`
- `ID` is the stimuli id, it can be ignored for this purpose
- `SRC` original sentence
- `MT` machine translated sentence
