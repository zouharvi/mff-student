# software process
software process includes activities: specification, design and implementation, validation, evolution
plan-driven (long term) / agile (incremental plan) processes

waterfall model 
- specification, development, validation are done in sequence
incremental development model (adaptive)
- activities are interleaved

includes:
- requirements analysis
- system and software design
- implementation and unit testing
- integration and system testing
- operation and maintenace


# requirements engineering
## uml diagram
## use case diagram
## activity diagram

requirements and constraints from stakeholders
can be high-level abstract statement or a detailed mathematical functional description
user/system requirements
functional/quality/domain requirements
should be complete and consistent
quailty requirements (usability, performance, space, security, ethical)
main categories: product, organizational, external

goal: general intention, such as ease of use
verifiable quality requirement: statement with some measure, that can be objectively tested

includes:
- elicitation
- analysis
- validation
- management

interviewing stakeholders
closed/open interviews (fixed questions/open minded)

requirements reviews (errors are more costly than implementation bugs)

## requirements document
can be written:
- natural language
- structured natural language
- graphical notations
- mathematical specifications

## usage scenario
- starts with user's intent
- ends with intent fulfilled
- description of starting situation, normal flow of events
- what can go wrong
- finishing state

## use-cases
- identify actors and interaction/activities
- any requirement can correspond to any number of use-cases

# processes
process - activity - action - task
## design activities
- architecural design
- interface design
- component design
- database design

verification/validation (is according to specification/user is happy)

testing is most common method of V&V:
- unit/component testing
- integration/system testing
- acceptance testing

non-executable prototypes are eg. paper mockups
Wizard of Oz prototype: only UI developed, requests passed to a person

Boehm's spiral
Rational Unified Process (TODO)

Capability Maturity Model Integration
level 0 - not performed
level 3 - defined precisely
level 5 - optimizing

# evolution
- evolution
- servicing
- phase-out

## Lehmanâ€™s laws
## maintenance
- corrective
- preventive
- adaptive
- perfective

reengineering
- rewriting system without changing functionality
