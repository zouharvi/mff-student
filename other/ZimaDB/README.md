## Documentation
Read concept assignment, user and technical docuementation in `doc_meta/`.

## Build
`make` (**ZimaDB** is already the default target)

`make run` will build & run **ZimaDB**.

`make re` will clean & run **ZimaDB**.

We used a makefile with a simple cascade, but due to linkage complexity we work in three main directories: `share/`, `engine/` and `core/`.

`engine/` (storage, processor) is maintained by Petr Chmel and `core/` (lexing, parsing) by Vilém Zouhar.

## Requirements
- The `readline` library is needed to build the program. It can be obtained from most of the maintained repositories, eg. `dnf install readline-devel`.
