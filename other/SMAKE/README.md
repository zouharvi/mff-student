# SMAKE Simple Markable And Keyword Extractor

First version based on RAKE (Automatic Keyword Extraction from Individual Documents), but the formula changed later significantly  (code in `manual_formula`). The plan is to create a manual feature extractor and feed these vectors to two dense layers with TensorFlow binding.

## Speed

### Language comparison

Out of curiosity the first version of the program (at `manual_formula` f9fdd9d4) was rewritten to an almostâ„¢ equivalent code in Python. It was then tested on 5x supersampled Hulth 2003 dataset (5000 docs).

|program|user|hit ratio|
|-|-|-|
|Python 3.8.2|4.76s|1.682|
|Rust debug|14.859s|1.741|
|Rust release|0.77s|1.742|
|CS .net core debug|2.19s|1.742|
|CS .net core release|2.18s|1.742|

### Optimization

The first round was measured on 100 huth2003 documents (1000-1099) on a hot run.

|description|user|
|-|-|
|base|4.3s|
|DocAll introduction|4.3s|
|crf removal|4.2s|
|frq_map access optimization|3.8s|
|deg_map access optimization|3.7s|
|lazy_static candidate regex building|2.4s|
|lazy_static split regex building|0.89s|
|uncontr wrapping|0.85s|
|keywords cleanup|0.82s|

The second run was measured on all huth2003 documents (1000) on a hot run.

|description|user|
|-|-|
|base (keywords cleanup)|83s|
|document word->occurence mapping|3.6s|


## Dataset

Test runs are based on 1000 docs from Hulth 2003.
