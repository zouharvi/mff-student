\section{Even permutations}

\textbf{Note}

Composition is performed from the right.

\textbf{Lemma 1}

Any 3-cycle can be composed from 3-cycles of the form $(1, i, j)$.

\textbf{Proof}

For 3-cycles without $1$: $(a, b, c)$, this is trivially $(1, a, b)(1, b, c)$. For 3-cycles with 1: $(a, b, 1)$ we already have a solution.

\textbf{Lemma 2}

Any 3-cycle can be composed from 3-cycles of the form $(1, 2, j)$.

\textbf{Proof}

If the 3-cycle contains consecutively $1$ and $2$, then we are done. If it contains consecutively $2$ and $1$: $(a, 2, 1)$, then we apply the 3-cycle twice: $(a, 2, 1) = (1, 2, a)(1, 2, a)$.

If the 3-cycle contains $2$, but not $1$, then we simply apply Lemma 1. If the resulting 3-cycles contain $1, 2$ consecutivelly, then ok. If not, we can break them down again using applying the 3-cycle twice as previously.

If the 3-cycle contains $1$ and not $2$, then $(1, a, b) = (1, 2, b)(1, 2, b)(1, 2, a)(1, 2, b)$ and from Lemma 1 we can construct any 3-cycle of this form.

\textbf{Lemma 3}

$A_n$ is generated by 3-cycles of the form $(i, i+1, i+2)$.

\textbf{Proof}

From Lemma 2 we known, that any 3-cycle can be composed of more elementary cycles of the form $(1, 2, k)$. For $A_3 = \{ (1), (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2) \}$ we need only the generator $(1, 2, 3)$. For $A_4$ this is also true (checked programmatically by exhaustive state search). For $n \ge 5$: $(1, 2, i)$ it is obvious for $i = 3$ and for $i = 4$ it is also true, because $(1, 2, 4) = (1, 2, 3)(1, 2, 3)(2, 3, 4)(1, 2, 3)$.

For $i\ge 5$: $(1, 2, i)$ $= (1, 2, i-2)(1, 2, i -1)(i-2, i-1, i)(1, 2, i-2)(1, 2, i-1)$. From Lemma 2 we know, that any 3-cycle can be create by the product of 3-cycles of the form $(1, 2, j)$ and from the lecture we know, that any $A_k$ is generated by 3-cycles.


\textbf{Theorem}

Since we can use $\sigma = (1, 2, 3, \ldots, n)$, we can also use $\sigma^{-1} = \sigma^{n-1}$. Since we have $\alpha = (1, n-1, n)$, we can also use $(1, 2, 3) =\ ^{\sigma^2}\hspace{-0.2cm}\alpha$. This was we can create arbitrary cycle of the form $(i, i+1, i+2) = \ ^{\sigma^{1+i}}\hspace{-0.2cm}\alpha$. From Lemma 3 we know, that 3-cycles of the form $(i, i+1, i+2)$ generate $A_n$, so it can be also generated from $\alpha, \sigma$.
