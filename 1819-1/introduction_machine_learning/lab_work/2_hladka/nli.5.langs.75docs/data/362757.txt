The question that `` youg people enjoy life more than oder people do ? '' isn t right at all .
I mean some old people enjoy their life also .
On the one hand young people are younger their body do everytihng what tehy want to do .
But on the other Hand young people don t do the right things that helps their to live longer .
For example they smoke more than older people , because it seems cool .
And usually they take drukes and often they drink more .
These are all thing which shows that young people enjoy their life .
But it isn t so , I mean when young people do that they want to go more to the death and they aren t enjoy their life they make it smaller .
In opposite of the younger people older people enjoy their live , too .
But not like the younger it do .
They cannot do much more things , because they have families and a job .
They want to live for their family .
They must work to get money to buy foods and some other needs .
They must show their children that they are good parents that do everything for their families .
But I mean , no I think , that oder people do the same thing like the younger people in their past .
We can that both are , I mean older people and the younger people , enjoying their life .
The older people do it in the past and the younger people do it now .
For me is enjoying the live very important , because when someone enjoy his life , he can say in future that he miss his past .
He can ask his children the past of his live and he can say his children what to do in some situations .
It s like the history , but of the personility of one human .
I think that I enjoy my life but not more than my father it did , because we live in modern time , nothing happens at tis time .
But at the time wher my father was younger there happens so many things .
The world have change at that time , for example computers were made and other things .
I hope that I enjoy my life in the Future .
