Today adertisements are everywhere ; television , newspaper , magzine , even on the surface of the cars .
Those products on the ads always look so nice , but are they really like how they are decribed on the ads ?
No .

Using stars is a very common stradegy for ad .
For example , those famous models that appear on the skin production ads suggest people to use that product , saying it 's really good and all .
Makes people it is that product that actually made her so beautiful , but sometimes they do n't even use it at all .

Some ads about food says it would make you feel you are in the some place alse , like in the park , on top of the moutain , in the wild nature , etc .
It 's just so unreal , and i never trust those kinda ads .
They often uses No.1 in the nation , No.1 in the state , or No.1 among same business .
But sometimes you can see there are more than one No.1 ; so which one you can trust .

So overall , i think ads are just used to make products look better , so people will buy them .
