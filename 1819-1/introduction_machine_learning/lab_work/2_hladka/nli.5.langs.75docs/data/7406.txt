I do agree with the satement that `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , because Iam a teenager of this generation .
But if I would be a old generation teenager I would would think about this statement , I have a reasonable reasons for both of them which are explained below .

If Iam a teenager of this generation I would strongly agree with the staement , because this generation is a well forward generation than aprevoius one , a lot of changes had came in this generation , the techonology is very much developed so as the minds of the people esspecially teenagers .
They are well matured and knows about the outer world much better than the old aged people in this generation .
They really enjoy the things much better than a old age person do , because they are well aware of all the consequences about what they are doing .
For example , think of a student who tries to dirve a car in avery small age but his father is worried about him but he knews the consequences of it and drives a car which he enjoys a lot while driving .
But if Iam a previous generation tenneager i would really think of it because the envoirnment then was not as today where we cant find a place to enjoy a lot .
The main reason behind that is there no development at that time in many areas .

And taking in view of old aged people they dont seems to enjoy more as the teenagers or young people do because , they are bound to there family and responsibitlies , which make them to look after all the family matters and they hardly have a time to enjoy the beautifull world .
The old age people dont notenjoy a lot but they help their children do that .
The young people doesnot have any soght of pressure on them such as family matters , bussiness and so on .
So they can enjoy a lot where as a old age person cannot .

On conclusion , I strongly agree with the stament because of the above provided reasons and examples which imples the statement .
