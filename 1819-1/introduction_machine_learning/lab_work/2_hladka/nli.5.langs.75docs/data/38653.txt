I agree with this statement .
In my opinion , if you want to be successful in your live , you have to take some risks on several moments .

For example , people who only do things that they know it always go well usually do n't settle for changing their job .
Because of that , they can lose a magnifical ocassion for getting a best job and also for earning more money .

On the other hand , on numerous ocassions successful people start new bussiness although they are not sure they will go well .
But , they do n't bother doing that because they usually are very positive people .
Even things do n't go too well , this kind of people can see the positive side of things .

In contrast , taking too risks have also some drawbacks .
Before taking an important decission we have to think slowly about all things and risks it has .
We must be very careful with our money and with the people who love and do n't take risk with them .
If we always take decissions quickly perhaps some day we will have problems .
