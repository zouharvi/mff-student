I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for many reasons .

First , we a very new to the place and if we a in a group there are very less change to get lost in the unknow place .
It is better to have a group .
We can enjoy the site by sharing our own ideas with the other preson .
In a group they can take good care of the other preson if they r not well .

Second , having a tour guide is the best way to travel .
Guide is the person how is very familier with the place so he can help us to now the history of the place .
He ( guide ) also take us to the very important places , which we can not find them with ourself .
He also help us in selecting the place to rest and have great food .

Third , people make many good friends in the tour .
In a group no one feels bore of the tour ; because in the free time they can enjoy by dancing , singing around the campus fire .
