I 'm disagree with this statement .
There are very differences in young and older people enjoy .
The energy in young people can influence in their enjoy For example the young could to dance every night , but it is n't to older people , so they are not enjoy in a party every night .
The health is other factor to people enjoy .
If I 'm sick and I wanna to drink beer with some friends , I could not .
The mode of enjoy life is determinated how it see the life .
If I like the parties but I 'm older for it , is obvius that i 'm not enjoy life .
But if I like swim in the ecean and I can do it , then I could enjoy life in every moment .

The young have their own enjoy , so the older have their own enjoy .
I could n't to say this enjoy life more than this other , because their likes are very differents .

I think the people that do the things as like them , they enjoy life , it would be young or older , anybody would be very happy .

Finally , the energy , the health , the likes or dislikes influence in our enjoy .
The young people or the older people can enjoy life alround their likes .
Anybody could enjoy life .

When I do the wanted , then I enjoy life .
Whatever , wherever and whenever I can enjoy life , but It have to like me , I have to can do it , young or older I enjoy life , it is not determinate for the age or for the times .
It could be always when you want to do it !
