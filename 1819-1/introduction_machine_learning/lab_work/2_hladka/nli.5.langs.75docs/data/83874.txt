It is a contradictory statement .
First I agree because if a student learns ideas and concepts can take decisions .
With an idea or concept a student can think about uses , aplications or simply examples of the topics from where it came .
P.e. if you think on a different equipment that you can do with something cilinder ( the idea is the cilinder ) , you get aplications of it like you can do a drum , a tunnel , etc .

Ideas and concepts can be used to priorize different subjects and to focus on a principal goal to be sucessfully , p.e. if you get different ideas of an electrical problem that you have on class , like motors no running you can think about solution to solve it and be sucess like check the breaker , test the current before the motor or some others .

Sometimes is mixed the ideas and concepts get students to facts , and otherwise some facts , let students to get ideas and concepts .
But second I have to disagree because when a student gets facts and learns from it , this knowledge let undertand what happen and can change the behavior of certainly act or activities , p.e. if you know that when you laugh in class disturb the class and the teacher is not feeling good with that behavior , and you are going to get your scores based on knowledge but also on certain appreciation of the teacher , you can modify it and do not laugh in so the teacher will be feel better with your presence and will be take it in consideration before put your scores .

So this is a contradictory statement because for students both things are important to understand ideas and concepts in one hand but in the other to learn facts , and aplying all of this can get sucessfully .
