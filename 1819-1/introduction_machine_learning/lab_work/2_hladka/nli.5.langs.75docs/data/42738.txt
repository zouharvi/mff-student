I disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knoledge of many acadamic subject than spesialized one .
One of the most imoprtent thing is time factor , so spending much time on one subjects we will me good and master at the subject .
For example , in the higher level education universities offering only in perticular subject rather than on prefer in more subjects .
Broad knoledge will keep a person in the top in the position and every problem regading that will be solved by the person .
speacialize acadamic subject will produce more bettre resulets , when the person is more intrest in that subject .
for examle , in the school some people get good marks in the perticuler subjects when compare to the other subjects , at this time we will encourage him in his intresting subjects rather than other .
In later years he will be master at the subject and will takes researchs in the field he will discover more intresting results in that area .

Let 's take an example from the hestory of maths , great mathamatician Pythagars , in his school days he always preffer to solve maths problem to that of other subjects like social , science .
After few years he became a great mathametician , this is truly because of his broad knoledge in that perticuler subject .
From , this examle we can say that the perticuler subject should his intresting subjects .
So , from the several reasons and examples we can conclude that its better to have broad knoledge in one subject .
