The question about broad oder specialized education is rather difficult to solve .
In my opinion there is no clear answer or solution to this problem .
I think that a broad knowledge of many subjects is essential to succeed in work .
For example in economics , is is very important to have certain knowledge of law , mathematics or information systems to only mention a few connected fields of study .
Without background knowledge in these fields you will not be able to get a good degree in your study .
Also it is important to have knowledge of culture and society , especially when you want to work and live in other countries .
Here it is extremely neccessary that you learn something about the culture of the foreign country , so that you can live there as a part of the community .
Also everybody should have a basic knowledge about the history of his country or geographical circumstances of the region he lives in .
This knowledge can be seen of a basis that every person succeeding university should achieve .

But beneath this broad knowledge it also is quite useful to have a highly specialised knowledge in one certain field .
In this specialized subject , you then can enjoy being a expert .
This can not only be good for your personal career .
If nobody wanted a highly specialized training , there would be no progress in science .
Here we have good examples in natural sciences , for example physics .
Every student of physics needs a basic education that also includes mathematics and chemistry .
But to research in problems , that matter at present time , you need to highly specialize , because there is so much information , that a single human being would never be able to gain it all .

Therefore I would say that you both need a broad knowledge of many subjects that are connected , but also must specialize in one field of study .
A reasonable combination of this two aspects of training can give you an education , that will open you all doors for a future career .
