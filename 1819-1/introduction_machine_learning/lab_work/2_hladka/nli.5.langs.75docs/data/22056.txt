Youth and health allow people to perform tasks that older people ca n't , it does n't mean that old people is confined and limited about the things they may do .
At the early begining of life you 're not much concerned or worried about what you have to do to make a living , you do n't even think that life may have an end , that way of thinking perphaps encourage to make things without considering the consecuencies they may have .
it has to be defined first what enjoying is , it may differ from person to person , we cannot compare a muslim and a mormon , they way they see the world does n't necessarily agree .
Getting back to the point , young people have not lived what , perphaps , old people have , that lack of knowledge an experience is a good reason to explore life .
Old people lived their youth in a different time , with different manners and accostumed to things that can be considered as old-fashion .
Values missconception have made old people belive that the young people does n't know how to get the most out of life in a decent way , they treat , sometimes , young people like criminals because they do n't share some point of view about life , about the fast-changing life that we have to live nowdays .
We 're actually living in a world without communication frontiers , it allows to share the way we live with others and to compare , we may like what is done in other countries and we could like to behave like that .
Young people enjoy more life beacuse they can hardly see the difference between what is right and wrong , and sometimes the feeling they get from breaking the rules makes them `` enjoy '' more .
In my opinion , you need health to enjoy the life but enjoy is a state of the mind , you have to find joy in your heart no matter how old you are .
I hope I will have this way of thinking when I 'm 80 .
