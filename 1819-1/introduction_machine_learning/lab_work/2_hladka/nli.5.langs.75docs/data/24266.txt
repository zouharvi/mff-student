Coca Cola 's new product , CocaCola Zero , announced some months ago with huge advertisements , provoqued a great echo all over the world .
A sweet nutrition without sugar , that was the strategy to sell a popular product in even greater amounts .

But in my opinion , the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is true in many cases .
Advertisements argue that the quality of the product they want to sell is better than that of all other producers , but it is available at the same or even a lower price .
The consequences I draw out of this strategy are firstly , the production costs were reduced or , secondly , the quality of the product is not as good as the advertisement wants to tell us .

Regarding sugar free products , for example , it is clear that an artificial substance has to replace the sugar by keeping the taste .
Then the product may be sugar free , but added with many artificial ingredients which are not mentioned or written on a place hard to be seen by the customers .

As a second example , I will mention shortly the consequences of advertisements denying the real quality of the product by regarding cosmetic products .
Especially young people who have problems with their skins are attracted by advertisements which promise to help them with a product wich costs less than others but has better impacts on the skin .
In the meantime , the ingredients of this product do not help or have even negative effects the customers do not get to know by reading the instructions .
So young people trie one product after another just following the false promises of some advertisements .

In the end , advertisements always play with their direct or indirect influence on the customer .
And unless the customer does not reflect this influence critically , the producers will not change their habitude in making the products seem much better than they are .
