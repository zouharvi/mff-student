First i would like to say that life does not stop at acertian age , so i have to disagree with this statment .

But also i must say that there are somethings that old people cant do anymore , never the less there are even more thing they still can do , as long as the person is surounded by his loved ones , have a good hobby or still knows how to life in the eyes of his children he 'll always enjoy life .

A young person could enjoy the things that the old persons had already enjoyed .

For young people a need for exploring , for going to places , for speeding from time to time , for there heart beatting faster and faster as they start to feel love in thier souls is a must .

For old people they 've seen it all - or at least thats whats they 're saying - they want the quit nights , the early sleep , the healthy food , and a vacation to an island that he always dreamed of .

For example a night of playing pingo with your friends and wife , going fishing with the child of your sun or going from time to time to your old work , all these things would mean the joy for an old person .

Where a young man or girl would feel bored if he / she had to do any of these things everyweek , he would rather be in a party or with his girl , or playing a hard game like football or basketball , she would rather be in the mall getting ready for the pram .

And in the other hand the life of young people is not suitable for old people , to party every time you could , to play and move all the time .

So every age has its own style , its own magic , its own ENJOY .
