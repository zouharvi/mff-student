I agree with the following statement depending on my own experience .
there are 3 reasons supporting my point of view , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

First , the defination of learning something is to acknowledge why things goes like that which is , in other words , to know fundations and the priciples of it .
To learn facts such as `` the sun rises every morning and sets every evening '' is not actually `` knowing '' something , to understand why the sun act like this which could be explain as `` the earth is going around the sun '' is the real knowledge one can get .
That 's why either traditional school or experimental school both tend to explain clearly to students what 's going on under the consequence .

Sencond , the biggest difference between human beings and animals is human can understand some mind or idea which , unlike simply facts , are not visible and make a conclusion .
Some expriment states that , some kind of monkey can learn facts and make simply conclusion of what 's going to happen next .
But they cannot understand ideas above the consequence .
That 's the advantages that human beings live and develop .
So it is of vital importance to let student learn to understand ideas more than just know facts .

Third , the yield of our society comes from creation and the followed construction .
Creation is a complex thing which base on the accumulation of ideas .
When one have many ideas which like bricks , he can easily put some of them together to make another thing like a building .
And idea is also important to construction .
While build some constructions , to know how can it be stable on ground is an idea of calculation .

So it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
