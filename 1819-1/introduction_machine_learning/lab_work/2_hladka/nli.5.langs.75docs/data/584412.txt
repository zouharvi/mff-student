I totally agree with the statement given above that advertisment make products seem much better than they really are .
If you believe everything what the producers say and what they sale then maybe you think that you buy the best product .
But if you know that they give you not all the information , most people recognize the reason behind the advertisement .

For example in politics , during the election , most of the electors vote for the candidate with the best advertisement .
Though they even know their ambitions .
So the politicians waste most of their money to emphasize their popularity .
But it is no matter of fact that the most popular politician makes the best politics .

I think the importants thing is to get into it if you want to be sure to by the best products .
But you should never be sure if an advertisement told you that you bought the best
