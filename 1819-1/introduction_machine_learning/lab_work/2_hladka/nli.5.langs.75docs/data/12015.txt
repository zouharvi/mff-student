I definitely do agree with the statement because of several reasons .

Firstly and most important , I suppose that learning just facts without understanding the idea or the concept behind , you do not have the context and the basis to keep single facts in mind for a long time .

In addition , knowing the ideas and concepts always enables you to learn the facts later , for example when you need them .

In generel , people do remember what they once unterstood but do forget what they just learned without understanding it .

On the other hand , it is sometimes easier for students to learn the facts , because they get easier and faster access to reading material and books than to lectures and learning events which might better explain the ideas and concept .

In the short term , it might also appear more effective to learn just the facts in order to get a proper preparation for tests , because it is often more efficient when tests just ask for the facts .

But in the long term , as I already said , it is much more effectiv to understand the concept which serves you as a valuable basis to put related knowlegde on .

Therefore , Proffessors , ought to attract students to attend the learnig events in order to get an overwiev of the topic and understanding the concept and backround .

From my own experience I know that I do not remember any facts of subjets , of which i did not understand the concept .
But in case I understood the idea and the context , I know where my notes are to get the demanded facts quickly .

Overall it becomes very clear that in the middle - and lorg term , understanding the concepts and ideas of a subject in order to learn effectively and keep things in mind , is much more effective than just learning the facts .
