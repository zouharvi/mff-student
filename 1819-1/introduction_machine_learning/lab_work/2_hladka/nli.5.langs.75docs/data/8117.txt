Being successful is about knowing what you are doing and how you are doing it .
But it 's also about taking chances and working hard to seek your ambitions and aspirations .
And to do so , people should try new things and take new chances .
But at the same time , they should be very careful with their actions and decisions , so that they wo n't regret if anything had happened wrong .

First , In order to be successful , people should know exactly what they want and what they are looking for .
For example , If a man wants to be successful in his job he needs to be working for something he really likes and he 's really good at .
And not doing something just because that was the only opprotunity he got .
He should try and find what he is good at and find what he really wants .
Having a successful life is about having a happy , fulfilled and satisfying life .

Second , People who want to be successful should go and find their own chances instead of just waiting for the chances to come to them .
And if they passed through something hard along the way they should try their best to make it through without crumbling .
They have to make the best out of everything .

Third , successful people have to obtain the knowledge and the wisdom on how to keep their success rising instead of falling .
Being successful once does n't mean that someday you wo n't be a failure .
A person has to be confident in his work so that he would n't regret his actions later .

To become a seccessful person and to obtain that postition .
You have to know what you are looking for , try to reach out for your goals , and being confident in what you are doing .
And at the end you will have a happy life .
