I agree with the statement but only partially .
Education is termed as the path to overall development of a person and since childhood people are trained in a variety of topics and after a certain age when they can decide for thmselves the person can chose a topic or subject of his liking and specialize in it

At the basic childhood level the school circulum include all the knowledge rquired for the child to view the world in the normal sense .
Subjects such as social and natural Sciences tell the everyday movements of the earth its location and how and why of many aspects of nature which interest the child at that age .

At high school level the subjects are dealt in detail and a fewer subjects are dealt at that stage so that the in depth knowledge of a few selective subjects is stressed .
This leads to the development of a personality and the young adult now can have a subject of his liking at undergraduate level .
The subjects learnt so far will also assist the person his or her chosen field of specilisation FOR EXAMPLE the use of concept of physics like gravity and momements of earth and other objects in space in the field of rocket science and design engineering .

At undergrauate level of education the person gets to decide about a specific subject and specilize it at his graduate and doctrate level of education if he choses to do so .
FOR EXAMPLE , consider the case of engineering at undergraduate level an electronics engineer can convert into a computer and electronics engineer at his graduate level using his computer knowledge on his electronic basics .

In conclusion , i have to say that although specific knowledge of an academic subject is important the need for knowledge on a variety of subjects is all the more important to attain an over all developed personality for a person .
Particularly in this day and age when a knowledge of variety of topics is needed to survive in this technologically submerged world .
