I do not agree to this point of view , that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
There are a lot of aspects , which speak against this .

The best example is in my opinion a doctor .
A doctor helps people , when they have physical problems .
I do not think that a doctor tries new things and takes risks , because this can lead to very negative effects , if he does this .
So he always has to do , what he has learnt and nevertheless he is very successful , although he always does he knows how to do well , but he helps other people .

Another example is the racing sport .
The car pilots cannot take risks , because also there this can lead to very negative effects and they would risk there own life , if they drive dangerously just to win a race and to be succesfull .

There are a lot of other jobs , where you cannot take any risks because this would have great effects on your own or other peoples ' lifes .
But zou can also be successful , if you take risks or trz new things , what the examples show .
