I agree with that statment , and in the following lines I will support my idea .

When we watch an advertisment about a product , in most of the cases we asume that the product is better than it probably is .

In effect , we think that the product has a good cualities because we asume that the producers make a lot of exams to probe his product , but when we buy the product , and we follow the advetisments , we sometimes we can notice that the product has not the sufficient advertisment that it supposed to be .

For example , if you buy a pesticide , and in the advertisments say that you can use in home , and you used in the plants of your home , in a few days your plants probably die .

The reason of thism is because the advertisments did not tell you that you can not use the pesticide in the plants of your home .

As we can see , because the advertisments we assumed that the pesticide was a good product , much better than really is .

In conclution , I agree with the statement , because in many times , the the advertisments make products seem much better than they really are , and when we used , we noticed that the products are not good .
