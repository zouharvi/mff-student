I do not agree this opinion .
In my idea , older people enjoy life more than young people do .
When persons is young , he and she do not know what is the life and how important of the life is .
Because they have less experient of life .
They maybe catch up with money , they maybe abandant themself in the luxury .
They can not recognize life is important to them .

When persons grow up , they work for life and they married and then have the baby of their own .
They begin to realize that life is more important for them .

A lot of person thought that young proson have the opptunity to enjoy life , and older person is late for enjoy the life .
I ca n't agree the idea .
Young person begin to their new life of them own .
They just enjoy themself not the life .
Life include family , associate , work , friends and so on .
Older person enjoy more family and associate , compared with young person enjoy more themself and friend .

In the sorround of me , there are a lot of youny person selfish and competive .
They can do whatever they want to achieve their goal .
When they got about 30 or more years old , they began to realize the life .
They found they have lost a lot important life with their family and friend .
They became peace , and began to enjoy the real life .
When they enjoy the life , they found which is more important for them yet .

In my conclusion , older people enjoy their life more than young person do .
But when young person got enough experience of the life , they will begin to love it .
Recognize the life need a long cource of experience .
recognize themself is also important to enjoying the life .
So young people enjoy life less than older people do .
