A lot of people think that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I personally believe that peole whoo only do what what they alresdy know how to do well are more successful than those who belong to the other category .
I have many reasons in support of this opinion of mine .

First and foremost , I feel that by doing what one is already good at one has a good grip over the subject to be dealt with .
This provides the person to think probe more deeply into his or her subject of specialization .
Thus success can be obtained quickly .
For instance , a friend of mine who graduated in financial engineering tookup a job as an analyst which involves his branch of study .
He tasted success within no time .
His salary doubled within a short period of six months .
In two years he grew to the position of a senior analyst .
A nother friend of his tookup a job totally different from his subject of study and ended up earning not even close to half of my friend 's salary .
Thus this kind of success comes faster and is more long lasting .
The risk involved is literally nothing .
It is any day a safer bet .

Aditionally , taking risks and doing new things may give nore scope for creativity .
But , the amount of time and work it consumes is is too much .
The results are not seen immediately .
A person who follows this path requires to have oodles of patience .
It is impossible to judge if the new thing will click or not .
In most cases the risk factor is high and the person has no idea of what he is doing .

Based on the above discussion , I feel that successful people are those who do what they are already good at rather than those who try new things and take risks .
