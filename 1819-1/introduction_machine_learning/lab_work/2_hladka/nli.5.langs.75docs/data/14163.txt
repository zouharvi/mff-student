According to the my point of view of the fact , ubiquoitus in my view .
young people enjoy life , better when compared to older ones , because they had more opputunities to enjoy in a better way , in terms of various scientific inventions which paved the platform for indulgance in various activities .
To substantiate my wordings i give the following reasons ..
The young are more energitic , enthusiastic .
The heated blood within them makes them more career oriented .
According to the medical facts .
people tend to go older in their in mind and body , as the age advances .
to the older ones are more responsible in their acts , hence they pay deaf ear to such enjoying acts .
On the contarary , the young are free from responsibilities .
they depend not wholy on the old , but to the fact on some occasions like guidence ..
they show various patterns of enjoyment , example , with friend to roam about , in disco `` s , in various cultural gatherisations .
on the hold pepole when turn old donot show much interest in various outdoor source of enjoyments .
but prefer to stay calm and cold .
The young enjoy by the latest advancements in modern scientific technology , what i mean is the Television , internet , cell phones , automobiles , music , increased career oppurtunities led to the fulfillment of goals , which led to furthur enjoyment , pleasure , satisfaction in what ever they do .
on the contrast olders ones , are more oriented in family development , mental peace , and various other activities which make them comfortable .
Iorder to strenghten my facts .
According to the current statistical medical records.70 % of the people recticated to vote that young enjoy better when compared to older ones ..
Hence therefore , it is mandatory to stick to the vague fact that young enjoy more when compared to the older ones .
But i stake to say that young ones enjoy better than old , but they have to enjoy with th older ones .
