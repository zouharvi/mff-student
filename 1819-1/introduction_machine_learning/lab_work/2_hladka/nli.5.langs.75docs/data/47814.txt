As a student , we learn a lot of different types of knowledge from teachers , classmates and textbooks , including ideas and facts .
The essences of fact and idea are different , and the skills to learn fact and idea are also different .
Some think that learning fact is the most essential thing ; others argue that understanding ideas is more important in learning .
There have been an agruement for a long time .
In my opinion , I agree that to understand idea and concept is more important .

My first reason is that understanding concept is the basis when we study , but memorizing facts will limit students ' thinking .
Once we understand the concept of the question , it will be mush easier to solve the problem by using the concept and idea .
On the other hand , if students only focus on the text and memorize the fact which is found by others , they lose the chance to think about the question on their own .

Another reason is that understanding concept and idea will help students to extend their own ideas .
Knowing the concept is the basis for innovation .
For example , although many inventors do not accept regular education , they practise and extend their own idea and imagination just based on the concept .
Most of the inventions are from the concept of materials and the inventor 's creativity .
In other words , without just learning the fact from books , understanding concept give students more space to imaginate and try .

Tos ummarize , I think understanding the idea ans concept is more important than learning fact .
To learn fact is to learn something dead , however , concept and idea are alive .
Knowing concept ecourages students to think deeply and creatively .
