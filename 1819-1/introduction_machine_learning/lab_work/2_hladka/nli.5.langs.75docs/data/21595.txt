Travel is always a good experiencia , no mater how we doed , but i really think is better to traveld leded by a tour guide .
If we traveld alone is like having a big aventure , but maybe we are going to experience some problems that can ruin the vacation .
In firts place , in most of the places we go to traveld , we know nothing abauted , so maybe we are going to get lost .
With a tour guide we cant visited all the important places od the place we are going to traveld .

In second place , a tour guide can bring us key information to undestand the places and culture that we visiting .
every culture have a particular history , that is the base of their actual status .
Knowig the culture , give us the oportunity to tasted the soul of the place we are .
Most of comun people did n't know a lot abaut cultures , son is a very good thing to have a tour gide that can bring us this kind of information .

In third place , a tour guide can bring us especial information about how we can satisfy the usual needs we have .
Places to dinner , palces to rest , places to spend the night , places of entertaiment , places to by remainders , etc .

Also a tour guide also can help us if the language represent a problem to us .
Ther are some many languages around the world , so is imposible for a person to know every speaking language .
A tour guide it can be a instrument to comunicated we the people of the land we are visistig , so comunication is not have to be a problem to enjoy the traveld .

Finally a tour guide can bring some stability and a sense of secure .
Traveld with a tour guide it is the best way to traveld .
