The advertisements is very fast way used in currents days to purchas , to sell , to find fast your needs of different items that the humans requires .
The advertisement is to have show about items or things such as house , land , workers by televisions , newspapers and magazines or even through internet .
This essay focus on that most advertisemens make products seem much better than they really are .

Some people think that using things which is advertised is very beneficial as they are seeing that things in tv and news papers , for example buying furnitures through inernet .
this is very unusefull way as the conditon of the furniture is bad or good not seen .
Morever , through newspapers , if buying cars , that care will showed in nice photography whereas in the reality is very bad and damaging condition .
In addition to , all this things will end in wasting of the money .

Its often belived that going to sale place and seeing the items befor buying , renting or using is good , therefore the person can checke and find out if any damage is there .
For instance , buying used house hold items and equipment must be checked before taking .
The most adventage of that is first , time consuming to search and be satisfied with your goods .
Secondly , It is money saving .

It seems to me that Advertisment shows the product much better than real picture of the things .
People should check and find out the correct ways to purchase and market their things in order to not to be in situaion where they feel they have been cheated , Also the traders must be honest when marketing and selling their goods .
