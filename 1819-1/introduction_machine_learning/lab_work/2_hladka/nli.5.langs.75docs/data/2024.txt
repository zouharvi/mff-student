I thing the statement '' Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping thier communities '' is wrong and right .
You have to look at all aspect this statement give us .

On one hand existing enough people who do not interessting for communities .
These people are in their own world and could only see their own problems .
Sure , you have to manage your own life first till you can help other peole but there are also people who have a good life and no problems and are not interesstest in social life .

On the other side there are many young people , who are visiting old peole or doing other nice things .
The problem nowadays is the politics .
If the politics would not be as bad as it is in the moment , younger people would have their head free for other things like the communities .
For example , the problem to get a job is a very difficult thing .
Many factory - owners want to have good workers who should not be silly .
So the not intelligent persons are not getting a job .
If you have no job you can not buy food or can not rent a appartment .
When a young person has a problem like this , that he or she maybe has to sleep at the street , he/she can not look after the communities .

Sometimes also the problem exist that people want to help , but they can not because the social-houses are in a bad vioce .
If that happens there is no use for the biggest help .

So all in all you can see that for every statement you have to look at many aspects to get a result .
But in the end I think the statement is right because young people have their own things they have to do and could not care about so much aspects in their town .
And in the end you can see that every person is a little bit egoism .
That is very dissapointing but the truth .
