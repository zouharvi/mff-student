Teen age is the important part of one 's life .
When asked who will enjoy life more between youth and older people , I will incline to youth because of their energy , enthusiasm , tenderness , dareness and zeal to learn new and pleasant ones .

Teen age from14 years to 28 years is completely filled with energy and dare blood .
In that age they have oppurtunity to mould character .
Even they can do anything like naughty things in classes to enjoying parties with friends .
They will dare to do anything whatever they want because of their physical strength .

Another thing is in teen age they fill with enthusiasm .
They want to learn new things and they will success too if they have interest .
For this reason they want to know and learn new things they enjoy alot .

Also youth spend most of their time with friends rather than with family members .
With friends they always think of entertainment than studies .
That makes youth to enjoy life than older people .

In classes too , they will enjoy life by joking or immitating lecturers or making sarcastic statements on fellow students .
They will have strong desire and capability to do those things .
Due to the coordination between friends they use to dowhatever they want which we will not see in case of older people .

Students can not only enjoy life like this they even enjoy in academics prospects too .
For instance take a student who got good credits in a class .
That gives him alot of enjoyment and happiness .
The hardwork he has done for getting that good grade may be immense .
So finally if he gets fruitful result of what he had done to achieve that thing his enjoymrnt will be at its peak .

Older people can also enjoy life but due to family problems , health problems and lack of strenght they cannot enjot life as much as a teen would enjoy .
At last by the above examples and points I personally think youth especially between age 14-28 years can enjoy alot than a older person .
